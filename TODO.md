# Plan to Enhance IoTNewsBot with Google ADK Agents and Gemini LLM

## Objective
Enhance the `IoTNewsBot` by integrating Google Search as a tool and leveraging Google Gemini as the LLM using Google ADK Agents. The goal is to provide real-time, conversational responses to IoT-related queries while fetching and processing news efficiently.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Components
1. **LLM Agent (Google Gemini)**
   - Core reasoning and conversational capabilities.
   - Processes user queries and generates responses.
   - Model: `gemini-2.0-flash`

2. **Google Search Tool**
   - Fetches real-time IoT-related information from the web.
   - Acts as a supplementary data source to RSS feeds.

3. **Workflow Agents**
   - **Sequential Agent**: Orchestrates the flow of fetching news, processing queries, and responding to users.
   - **Parallel Agent**: Executes multiple data-fetching tasks (e.g., RSS feeds, Google Search) concurrently to improve efficiency.

4. **Custom Agent**
   - Handles complex workflows, such as combining results from RSS feeds and Google Search, and managing state.

5. **Streamlit UI**
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the bot.
   - Displays news and query responses.

## Agent Design

### 1. **LLM Agent**
- **Name**: `QueryProcessorAgent`
- **Model**: Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`)
- **Tools**:
  - Google Search Tool
  - RSS Feed Parser
- **Instruction**: "You are an IoT news assistant. Answer user queries by combining information from RSS feeds and Google Search."

### 2. **Workflow Agents**
#### a. **Sequential Agent**
- **Name**: `NewsProcessingPipeline`
- **Sub-Agents**:
  1. RSS Feed Fetcher
  2. Google Search Fetcher
  3. Query Processor (LLM Agent)

#### b. **Parallel Agent**
- **Name**: `DataFetcherAgent`
- **Sub-Agents**:
  1. RSS Feed Fetcher
  2. Google Search Fetcher

### 3. **Custom Agent**
- **Name**: `IoTNewsOrchestrator`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Combine results from RSS feeds and Google Search.
  - Manage state and ensure data consistency.
  - Handle error cases and retries.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup
1. Install necessary dependencies for Google ADK, Google Gemini, and Google Search integration.
2. Configure API keys and environment variables.
3. Set up a virtual environment for the project.

### Phase 2: Agent Development
1. **LLM Agent**:
   - Define the `QueryProcessorAgent` with Google Gemini as the model.
   - Integrate Google Search as a tool using Google ADK.
2. **Workflow Agents**:
   - Implement the `SequentialAgent` for orchestrating the news processing pipeline using Google ADK.
   - Implement the `ParallelAgent` for concurrent data fetching using Google ADK.
3. **Custom Agent**:
   - Develop the `IoTNewsOrchestrator` to manage workflows and state using Google ADK.

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Integrate the agents into the existing `IoTNewsBot`.
2. Update the Streamlit UI to display results from both RSS feeds and Google Search.

### Phase 4: Testing and Evaluation
1. **Local Testing**:
   - Launch a local web server using ADK's `api_server` command.
   - Test individual agents (e.g., `QueryProcessorAgent`, `DataFetcherAgent`) using cURL or API requests.
   - Validate workflows by simulating user queries and inspecting session states.
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the entire pipeline (Sequential and Parallel Agents) to ensure smooth orchestration.
   - Verify the combined results from RSS feeds and Google Search.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Use ADK's built-in evaluation tools to measure agent performance.
   - Analyze latency, accuracy, and response quality.
   - Implement callbacks for detailed tracing and debugging.

### Phase 5: Deployment
1. Deploy the application on Streamlit Cloud or another platform.
2. Ensure secure handling of API keys and environment variables.

### Phase 6: Push to GitHub
1. Initialize a Git repository if not already initialized.
2. Add all changes to the staging area using `git add .`.
3. Commit the changes with a meaningful message using `git commit -m "Enhance IoTNewsBot with Google ADK Agents and Gemini LLM"`.
4. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin main` (or the appropriate branch).
5. Verify that the code is successfully pushed to GitHub.

## Future Enhancements
1. Add more tools (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization).
2. Implement voice interaction using ADK's streaming capabilities.
3. Expand to other domains beyond IoT.
